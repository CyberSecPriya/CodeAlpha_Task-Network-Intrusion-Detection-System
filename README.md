# Project Overview

This project implements a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Snort, a widely-used open-source intrusion detection and prevention system. The system monitors network traffic in real-time, identifies suspicious or malicious activity based on predefined rules, and generates alerts to help detect and respond to network threats.

# Features

- Real-time monitoring of network traffic.

- Custom Snort rule sets to detect various network attacks.

- Alerts generated for suspicious network events.

# Tools Used

- Snort â€” open-source network intrusion detection and prevention tool.
