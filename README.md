# Project Overview

This project implements a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Snort, a widely-used open-source intrusion detection and prevention system. The system monitors network traffic in real-time, identifies suspicious or malicious activity based on predefined rules, and generates alerts to help detect and respond to network threats.

# Features

- Real-time monitoring of network traffic.

- Custom Snort rule sets to detect various network attacks.

- Alerts generated for suspicious network events.

# Tools Used

- Snort — open-source network intrusion detection and prevention tool.

# Installation Setup

You can keep the full section and add a short note like this at the beginning:

>  If you prefer a quicker setup, you can install Snort using:
> ```bash
> sudo apt install snort
> ``` 
> Otherwise, follow the full installation steps below to build Snort from source.

Follow these steps to install and set up Snort for the Network Intrusion Detection System:

**1. Install Dependencies**

First, update your package list and install necessary dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libpcap-dev libpcre3-dev libdumbnet-dev bison flex zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev openssl libssl-dev
```

**2. Download and Install Snort**

Download the latest stable version of Snort from the official website or repository. For example:

```bash
wget https://www.snort.org/downloads/snort/snort-2.9.20.tar.gz
tar -xvzf snort-2.9.20.tar.gz
cd snort-2.9.20
./configure --enable-sourcefire
make
sudo make install
```

**3. Configure Snort**

- Create necessary directories:
```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/snort
sudo mkdir /etc/snort/rules
sudo mkdir /var/log/snort
sudo mkdir /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrules
```

- Copy configuration files:
```bash
sudo cp ~/snort-2.9.20/etc/*.conf* /etc/snort/
sudo cp ~/snort-2.9.20/etc/*.map /etc/snort/
```
- Edit the main configuration file ``/etc/snort/snort.conf`` to include your custom rules and set the correct paths.

**4. Add Snort Rules**

- Download community rules from Snort website or create your own rules and place them in ``/etc/snort/rules/``.

- Update ``snort.conf`` to include your rules:
```bash
include $RULE_PATH/local.rules
```

**5. Running Snort**

Run Snort in IDS mode on your network interface (e.g., eth0):
```bash
sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0
```
- ``-A`` console outputs alerts to the console.

- ``-q`` runs in quiet mode.

- ``-c`` specifies the configuration file.

- ``-i`` specifies the network interface to monitor.

**6. Monitoring Alerts**

Alerts generated by Snort will appear in the console and can also be logged to files defined in the configuration.

# How It Works / Run

The Snort-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) works by analyzing real-time network traffic and checking it against defined detection rules to identify malicious or suspicious activity.

**Steps to Run:**

1. Make sure Snort is installed and configured correctly (see Installation and Setup section).

2. Add or edit rules in the ``local.rules`` file located at:
   ```bash
   /etc/snort/rules/local.rules
 
3. Run Snort in IDS mode with the command below (replace ``eth0`` with your network interface name):
   ```bash
   sudo snort -A console -q -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -i eth0

- ``-A console`` : Displays alerts in the terminal.

- ``-q`` : Runs Snort in quiet mode (no banner).

- ``-c`` : Path to the main configuration file.

- ``-i`` : Network interface to monitor.

Snort will now actively monitor traffic on the specified interface and trigger alerts when it detects suspicious activity based on the rules.

# Output

1. PowerShell Ping Output

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b9c13bb-dbec-4c72-be38-d2f25b8877a6)
   
This output shows a successful ICMP echo request (ping) from a Windows machine to ``172.21.218.49``. This traffic helps trigger Snort’s ICMP detection rules.

2. Snort Console Alert Output

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6810bae8-ad71-4a97-9af5-18a1f9ff9a10)
   
This output confirms that Snort is actively detecting ICMP packets on interface ``eth0``. The alerts show communication between ``172.21.208.1`` and ``172.21.218.49`` using ICMP (ping).

3. Snort Fast Alert File Output

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57fed049-98dd-44ef-9192-1a43664591f6)

This shows alerts logged in ``/var/log/snort/snort.alert.fast``. It includes:

- UDP-based UPnP scan attempts on port 1900

- IPv6-based ICMP packet detection between ``fe80::...`` and ``ff02::2``

These entries confirm detection of both network scans and ICMP traffic.

4. Snort Alert Log Output

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/451cd6b0-c00b-4821-892e-6d635098be19)

Additional logs from Snort showing ICMP packet detections (IPv6). These validate that Snort is logging activity correctly in its primary alert log.

5. Snort Alerts by Priority (Bar Chart)

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/640bc6cb-b3a7-4f0d-a966-54197c9aace8) 

This bar chart visualizes the number of Snort alerts based on their priority levels (e.g., Priority 1, 2, 3). It was generated using the ``visualize_alerts.py`` script after parsing Snort logs into a CSV.

# Note

- Make sure to run Snort with sudo or as root to access network interfaces.

- The network interface name (e.g., ``eth0, wlan0``) may differ on your system—verify with:
```bash
ip a
```

- Keep your Snort rules updated to detect the latest attack patterns.

- Snort should be run in a test or monitored environment to avoid interfering with live production traffic.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Snort can be used to implement a basic yet effective Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). By using custom rule sets and monitoring real-time traffic, Snort can help detect and alert on suspicious network behavior, forming a critical part of any cybersecurity infrastructure.
